# Examining the effects of estradiol on brain structure & memory
Sivaniya Subramaniapillai

## Summary 

The goal of this project is to investigate estradiol, age, and cortical thickness on memory performance (free recall vs. recognition).

## Project definition 

### Background

Estradiol is known to modulate memory performance in animals and humans. Thereâ€™s a substantial work of literature that points to estrogens important role in memory. Estrogen receptors are found in areas involved in memory processes such as the MTL and the PFC - the exposure of estradiol to these regions are critically thought to modulate memory performance. With aging, there are declines in estradiol, especially in women during the menopause transition. During this transition, women also self-report increased forgetfulness. Aging is also associated with widespread structural declines in cortical thickness. Goal: the goal of this project is to investigate the relationship between cortical thickness and estradiol on memory performance in  young and middle-aged adults

Declines in estradiol and cortical thickness in aging may contribute to this performance in women at midlife. 
The objective of my projective is to determine whether declines in cortical thickness and estradiol with aging is associated with declines in verbal memory in women at midlife specifically. I hypothesize that greater declines in estradiol in women at midlife is associated with greater declines in brain structure and worse memory performance. 
All structural T1 MRI images will be submitted to the CIVET automated pre-processing pipeline to compute CT measures, which measures CT at around 81, 000 points across the cortex. I will use the Desikan-Killiany Atlas which averages the cortical measruments for each subject for a set of 64 regions. For this analysis, I will specifically focus my analysis on prefrontal cortical regions. I will test the relationship between levels estradiol and cortical thickness in the PFC on verbal memory. 



### Tools 

* [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), to structure the text.
* Python for data visualization and analysis 
* Use of git/github

### Data 

Data is currently not accessible to the public (ethics).

### Deliverables

At the end of this project, we will have:
- The current markdown document, completed and revised.
- interactive plot demonstrating relationship between variables of interest (i.e, age) and outcome (memory)
- jupyter notebook of data analysis
